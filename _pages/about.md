Hello, hope you are doing great ! Thanks for visiting. This is my home on the internet. This website contains details about my projects, experience and resume. This also has a blog where I intend to post on various topics and tutorials regularly. If you are interested in any of these, please check them out by navigating through the above links.
# About me: 
By the way, my name is **Shanmukha** and I am currently pursuing PhD in Computer Vision & Robotics at *Auburn University* under ([Dr.Aakur](https://saakur.github.io/)). I previously did my Masters in AI & Robotics at *University of California San Diego (UCSD)* and Bachelors in Computer Science from *National Institute of Technology, Raipur ([NIT RR](http://www.nitrr.ac.in))*, India.<br><br>
**Fields of interest:** My major field of interest lies in the intersection of *Computer Vision*, *Robotics* and *Multimodal open world understanding*.<br><br>
**Rationale behind my interests:** The logic is very simple behind this. *Computer Vision* is the art of imparting sight to computers and *Reinforcement Learning* is the process of enabling general intelligence in computers thereby giving them the true powers (Adaptability and Self learning capability) of *Artificial General Intelligence* (we are nowhere close to this). My slight preference of *Computer Vision* over *Natural Language Processing* is because, if someday I had to choose only 1 sense out of 5 (vision, touch, taste, smell and sound) to keep with me I would go with vision. I guess, that's what most people would go with. Because, the way one sees things, shapes up the way one thinks...is what I believe in. Be it a human or a robot.
