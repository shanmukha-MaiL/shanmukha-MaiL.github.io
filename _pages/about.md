Hello, hope you are doing great ! Thanks for visiting. This is my home on the internet. This website contains details about my projects, experience and resume. This also has a blog where I intend to post on various topics and tutorials regularly. If you are interested in any of these, please check them out by navigating through the above links.
# About me: 
By the way, my name is **Shanmukha** and I am currently pursuing 1st year of my Masters in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Controls at University of California San Diego. I completed my undergraduation in the year 2020 in BTech *Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)* from *National Institute of Technology, Raipur ([NITRR](http://www.nitrr.ac.in))* with a CGPA of **9.09/10**.<br><br>
**Major Courses taken in BTech:**  C, C++, Data Structures & Algorithms, DBMS, Theory of Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Neural Networks, Cryptography & Security, Network Programming and Software Project Management.<br><br>
**Fields of interest:** My major field of interest lies in the intersection of *Computer Vision* and *Reinforcement Learning*. Sometimes I tend to go into *Natural Language Processing* as well.<br><br>
**Rationale behind my interests:** The logic is very simple behind this. *Computer Vision* is the art of imparting sight to computers and *Reinforcement Learning* is the process of enabling general intelligence in computers thereby giving them the true powers (Adaptability and Self learning capability) of *Artificial General Intelligence* (we are nowhere close to this). My slight preference of *Computer Vision* over *Natural Language Processing* is because, if someday I had to choose only 1 sense out of 5 (vision, touch, taste, smell and sound) to keep with me I would go with vision. I guess, that's what most people would go with. Because, the way one sees things, shapes up the way one thinks...is what I believe in. Be it a human or a robot.
