I have done some other interesting projects as well, like:
- Speech-to-Text using Deep Speech
- Bankruptcy prediction using Deep Learning 
- Coattention Mechanism for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis etc <br>

All of these above projects either didn't have images or are publications, hence not mentioned in the portfolio.<br>

I have also worked on some quality projects like Optical Character Recognition(OCR) of Devanagari script(Sanskrit/Hindi) and adding an ML feature in Medical Benefits Management System (MBMS) during my time as an intern in a couple of companies. These too don't make into my portfolio as I am not allowed to divulge specific details of them, like images.

Feel free to scroll through [CV](/cv/) and [Publications](/publications/) if you are interested to know more about the above mentioned projects.
