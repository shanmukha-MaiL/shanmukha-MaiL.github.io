Trained RetinaNet with ResNet-50 as backbone using Wobot intelligence's face
mask dataset on kaggle. Though the amount of <u>training time was limited</u> by GPU
hours on kaggle kernels, the detection of boxes on the test set was impressive.<br>
**Data:** [Wobot intelligence face mask data](https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset)<br>
**Algorithm:** RetinaNet, ResNet-50<br>
**Major tool(s):** *Pytorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas*<br>
